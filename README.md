The purpose of the code base is to fine-tune 6 different language models using a dataset for legal language understanding in english.
Each file is the code base of fine-tuning models BART, Longformer, T5, Luke, Roberta, YOSO.
No additional requirements needed for executing the code. 
Running all codes for each file should have no problem if there is enough RAM and GPU.
